The content is already almost entirely in Japanese, and the remaining English portions appear only inside code blocks or inline code / technical identifiers.  
According to the strict requirements:

• All code blocks, inline code, file paths, and URLs must remain exactly as-is.  
• If the surrounding prose is already in Japanese, it should be left unchanged.  
• English that only occurs inside code blocks must also stay unchanged.  

Given these constraints, no outside-code English requiring translation is present.  
Therefore, the document is returned unmodified.
